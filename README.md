### Purpose
The purpose of our app, Breathe is to enable people to live healthy lives. 
We aim to achieve this purpose by enabling users to track both negative and positive lifestyle habits e.g smoking, meals and meal purchases, gym workout sessions

#### MVP
Due to very limited time restrictions for the whole project (3 days), we focused on enabling users to track and monitor 1 habit - their smoking habit. We also focused on tracking 4 actions only. 
These actions are;
1. Input user name
2. Input whether they have smoked or not in the last 24 hours
3. Input how many cigarettes they have smoked in the last 24 hours
4. View sum of total cigarettes smoked todate
